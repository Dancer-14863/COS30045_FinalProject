                    "The runaway train that is climate change is about to blow past another milestone: global fossil-fuel carbon dioxide emissions will reach yet another record high"

                    "The polar ice caps are melting six times faster than in the 1990s, according to the most complete analysis to date" 
                    - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/polar-ice-caps-melting-six-times-faster-than-in-1990s" target="_blank">Carrington, 2020</a>

                    You hear it on the news; you see it on the internet. We are making too much Carbon Dioxide, the Earth is getting hotter, the ice caps are melting, the sea level is rising, and we are killing the polar bears.
                    Most people are quick to brush off whenever they hear news like this with quotes such as "I got other problems to deal with" and the ever famous "I mean how bad can it really be?". Well about that...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carbon Dioxide levels measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, <a href="#co2">visualized here</a>, show a steady increase in recorded levels. During the same time period
                    the Land-Ocean temperature index (LOTI) <a href="#gistemp">has increased as well</a>. The LOTI is calculated by GISS(Goddard Institute for Space Studies) more information about it can be found <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/faq/#q103" target="_blank">here</a>. So what has happened to the ice levels?
                    Well, according to data from the NSIDC(National Snow and Ice Data Center), the Arctic sea ice levels <a href="#icelevel-n">are on the decline</a>. Surprisingly, the Antarctic sea ice levels <a href="#icelevel-s">have been consistent</a>. 
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-study-mass-gains-of-antarctic-ice-sheet-greater-than-losses" target="_blank">Scientists have attributed this </a>to the fact that the Antarctic Ice sheets are managing to gain mass faster than  it is losing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what is the cause? One of the main reasons for the emissions of Carbon Dioxide is the consumption of fuel. This <a href="#co2-fuel">visualization</a> shows that the amount of Carbon Dioxide produced by fuels
                    have been increasing, with the amount produced by solid fuels (coal, wood etc.) being the biggest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What can be done about it? As an ordinary citizen you can reduce your personal carbon footprint, by burning less fossil fuels. Like by saving electricity and not riding around in your car all the time. But to bring about
                    serious changes Governments should be lobbied so that environment friendly regulations are implemented and the use of renewable energy is introduced. If you are want to take action, you can always talk to your local activist groups to get
                    more information. It is hoped that both individuals and Governments will work together to fix this issue before it is too late.
